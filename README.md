## Roadmap for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

The training is organized into separate folders for each technology: `html`, `css`, and `js`.  
Each technology folder contains multiple lesson folders.  
Inside each lesson folder, there are two subfolders:
- `notes`: Contains lesson notes and explanations.
- `assessments`: Contains exercises and assessments for practice.
